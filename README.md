In this Repository there are totally four folders. It is a project on To-Do List it means organizing the tasks and to complete them
and the four folders are

1) About : In this folder consist of indexmain.html, indexmain.css where it shows the features and login and sign up redirects
  
2) Images: It consist of a background image and video of the To-Do List

3) MainTask : It consist of 3 files todo.html, todocss.css, todo.js with help of html and css I designed the user interface (UI) as well as with the javascript I designed the functionalities for the page

   step 1 : In the page we will see a button "ADD TASK", If we click on it then it displays a form and after filling the task then by "ADD" button the task gets added.

   step 2 : It shows the task added in the Box

   step 3 : If we want to clear the task, then there will be "Dustbin" symboled button by hovering on it highlights as well by clicking it clears the task.

JavaScript :
    Here I used Browser Object Model(BOM) and well as Document Object Model(DOM) by clicking on the buttons they create divs (division tags) and forms and also functions like removing child elements and parent elements.
   
4) Sign-inFiles : In this Folder there are totally 5 files they are index.html,index.css,index.js for Login pages and indexsign.html,indexsi.js for Sign-in pages

JavaScript :
   1) As in Sign-in and Login forms I used LocalStoarge help to store the username and user-password details instead of backend (Stored in the Browser itself).
   2) When we fill the form with the username and password the localstorage stores the values in the form of JSON, It means object with group of arrays
   3) Where the arrays with indexes as String. I validated the Strings as that it takes only in the form of email (abc123@gmail.com) and passwords in checks as
      
      1 Capital Alphabet
      
      1 Small Alphabet
      
      1 Numerical
      
      1 Special Charcter
      
      8 to 16 range.
